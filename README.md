# Bluegrass Trainer

I've finally found a few components worth using that will help me on my quest to
create a bluegrass trainer. As an outgrowth from Ricky Mier's "Banjo Ascension"
formula, I see a broader need for an online tool (kind of like TuneFox) that
offers a simple interface for learning bluegrass tunes.
